# Q?

I'm 23 and I read books.

More specifically, I guess it's correct to call me a "[rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) programmer" at the moment, as that's what I'm primarily writing, but I have some pretty strong experience in Typescript.

## Q?

Well, my main personal project at the moment is a videogame. I started work on a videogame 2 years ago, and as is typical, it still isn't released.

I'm pulling something like 40 hour work weeks on this alongside working a real job; the exact kind of nonsense you can only barely physically get away with in your early 20s.

## Q?

[Tachi](https://github.com/zkrising/Tachi) is the largest thing I've got publically released and contains a good 3 or 4 years of work.

While I wrote almost all of the code that powers the thing, at the moment I possess a sort of managerial role over Tachi, spending more time reviewing PRs than writing any code myself.

Designing it so that other people can contribute and help out with something they legitimately personally care about is a big pride point for me. I've met some excellent friends from it.

## Q?

It is a rhythm game score tracker. That means that when people get scores in a game, they get ingested by Tachi and turned into nice dashboards and tables and graphs that people share with their friends.

Tachi boasts an impressive ratio of around 3000 users to 5 million scores. While it's not a lot of People, it's definitely popular within its niche.

## Q?

Isn't it obvious?
