# Q?

I'm 23 and I read books.

More specifically, I guess it's correct to call me a "[rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) programmer" at the moment, as that's what I'm primarily writing, but I have some pretty strong experience in Typescript.

## Q?

Well, my main personal project at the moment is a videogame. I started work on a videogame 2 years ago, and as is typical, it still isn't released.

I'm pulling something like 40 hour work weeks on this alongside working a real job; the exact kind of nonsense you can only barely physically get away with in your early 20s.

## Q?

[Tachi](https://github.com/zkrising/Tachi) is the largest thing I've got publically released and contains a good 3 or 4 years of work.

While I wrote almost all of the code that powers the thing, at the moment I possess a sort of managerial role over Tachi, spending more time reviewing PRs than writing any code myself.

Designing it so that other people can contribute and help out with something they legitimately personally care about is a big pride point for me. I've met some excellent friends from it.

## Q?

It is a rhythm game score tracker. That means that when people get scores in a game, they get ingested by Tachi and turned into nice dashboards and tables and graphs that people share with their friends.

Tachi boasts an impressive ratio of around 3000 users to 5 million scores. While it's not a lot of People, it's definitely popular within its niche.

## Short engineering advice:

- Just write the code and solve the business problems you have.
- If your type system doesn't have sum types it shouldn't be taken seriously. I know this sounds harsh but not knowing this is equivalent to a mathematician not knowing about "zero" or "one" or "adding numbers".
- If you don't know what sum types are then shut the fuck up about type systems.
- Explaining a thing is not the same as justifying it. Engineers can explain things like design patterns or `==` in Javascript but then conflate them with them being justified. The best thing you can do is cut out anything unjustifiable and recognise when you're on stupid self-imposed puzzles.
- You can "just" do things. You can just run a server. You can just learn SQL and not some abstraction. You can just write a shell script to do it.
- All systems are criticisable. Clearly understandable systems are the *most* criticisable because the barrier to making jabs is so low. Complex systems evade criticism because the critics fear they don't understand it. Because of this, all things become complex under the guise of becoming "serious" or "proper". It takes serious, active mental effort to overcome this bias.  
- If you don't benchmark things you likely have no idea what you're doing performance wise. Web devs like to guess performance in their heads. They also only know two ways of of optimising a thing: Adding a cache, and paying money to cloud services. Both of these are wrong.
- Likewise, when you don't observe things for yourself you are vulnerable. Cloud services have massive financial incentives to get you to believe things like "Only Next.JS can handle scale" and "you need to use MongoDB for this" and "only (COMPLEX THING) can do X". Go load a modern website, and then [go load some php5 bullshit](https://auno.org/ao/char.php) from 20 years ago. Which of these would you actually listen to performance advice from? Web devs are hallucinating performance in their heads. Don't listen to them.

## Q?

Isn't it obvious?
